## Description of project
My project is a Drug Information & Interaction Checker web app. It allows users to:

- Search for a Drug – Users can enter a drug name, and the app fetches details (purpose, dosage, and side effects) from an online database (FDA API).

- Save Favorite Drugs – Users can save drugs to a list for future reference. Each saved drug has a delete button for removal.

- Reset the Search – A reset button clears the search input and results.

- The app is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically updates content without reloading the page.
